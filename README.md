# Kubernetes - kube-proxy Explained with Examples

##  kube-proxy in Simple Words

- **kube-proxy** runs **on every Kubernetes node**.
- It ensures that **network traffic** reaches the correct Pod.
- It manages **iptables** (or **ipvs** / **eBPF**) rules on the node.

>  kube-proxy is responsible for **routing** and **load balancing** traffic to the correct Pods behind a Service.

#  kube-proxy Common Examples

## Example 1: Service Type: ClusterIP

Create a Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

**What kube-proxy does:**
- Sees the Service (`my-service`) created.
- Configures **iptables rules**:
  - Requests to **my-service:80** are forwarded to **one of the matching Pods** on port **8080**.

âœ… Any Pod inside the cluster can now reach **my-service** easily.

---

## Example 2: Service Type: NodePort

Expose a Service as NodePort:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    nodePort: 30080
```

**What kube-proxy does:**
- Configures iptables rules:
  - Requests to **NodeIP:30080** are forwarded internally to the Pod on **port 8080**.

âœ… Even external users can now access the service using `NODE_IP:30080`.

---

## Example 3: Load Balancing

Suppose your Service has 3 Pods behind it.

When kube-proxy receives traffic:
- It **load balances** traffic **across the 3 Pods**.
- Selection is done randomly or round-robin.

âœ… kube-proxy automatically ensures basic **load balancing**.

#  Quick Traffic Flow Visuals

## NodePort Access (External -> Internal)

```
External User -> NodeIP:30080
             -> kube-proxy intercepts
             -> forwards to PodIP:8080
```

## Internal Pod Access (Service IP)

```
Pod A -> my-service:80
      -> kube-proxy routes to Pod B:8080
```

---

#  kube-proxy Modes

- **iptables** (default): Uses Linux iptables.
- **ipvs**: More efficient, uses Linux IPVS for load balancing.
- **eBPF**: Used by modern CNI plugins like Cilium; fastest routing at kernel level.

# ðŸ“¦ Final Summary Table

| Feature | How kube-proxy Helps |
|:--------|:---------------------|
| Internal Pod communication | Routes Service IP to Pod IPs |
| External NodePort access | Routes NodeIP:NodePort to PodIP:TargetPort |
| Load balancing | Distributes traffic across multiple Pods |

---

# ðŸ”§ Bonus Tip
> Always remember: kube-proxy only **listens to changes from the API Server** and **updates local node rules**. It doesn't modify Pods or containers directly!

---

# ðŸ“ˆ Recommended Next Steps
- Draw the full **Service to Pod traffic flow** on paper once.
- Experiment by exposing simple Nginx Pods via ClusterIP and NodePort!
- Check iptables rules on a node using:

```bash
sudo iptables -L -t nat
```
